# PythonCourseraCoursework

To communicate with SQL Databases from within a JupyterLab notebook, we can use the SQL “magic” provided by the ipython-sql extension.
Magic is JupyterLab’s term for special commands that start with “%”. Below, we’ll use the load_ext magic to load the ipython-sql extension. 
In the lab environemnt provided in the course the ipython-sql extension is already installed and so is the ibm_db_sa driver.
